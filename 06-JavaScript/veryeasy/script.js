// VERY EASY: Create two variables and assign a number to each. Example output: 
// Console log the difference between the numbers.
// “The difference between 6 and 2 is 4”
var num1 = 6;
var num2 = 2;
var diffence = (num1 - num2);
console.log('The diffence between ' + num1  + ' and ' +  num2 + ' is ' + diffence);
